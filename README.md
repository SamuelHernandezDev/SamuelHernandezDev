### 👨‍💻 About Me
I'm a Web Developer with a strong focus on **frontend development**, working mainly with **React, JavaScript, and TypeScript** to build and maintain web applications.

I have experience developing **dashboards, data tables, and responsive user interfaces**, as well as consuming and integrating **REST APIs** with backend services. I’m comfortable reading and modifying existing code, fixing bugs, and implementing new features based on requirements.

My backend experience is at a **basic junior level**, mainly using **Node.js and Express**, along with **relational databases (SQL)** for simple queries and data handling.
