### 🌟 About Me
I'm a Computer Systems Engineering student with experience developing **academic and personal projects** focused on **software automation, data management, and system integration**.

I enjoy building applications that go beyond basic CRUD systems, integrating:
- Databases and performance analysis
- Automation using cloud services
- Role-based systems and reporting
- Backend and frontend communication

Many of my projects are designed around **real operational scenarios**, such as enterprise reporting systems, data validation pipelines, and interactive applications.
